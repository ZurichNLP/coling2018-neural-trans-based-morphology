# Research code for the coling 2018 paper "" by Peter Makarov and Simon Clematide 
This code basis allows for the reproduction of the results of our experiments.
Note that there is a separate git repository that contains all our test data results of our reported systems (https://github.com/ZurichNLP/coling2018-neural-transition-based-morphology-test-data) in a consistently organized way.


## Requirements
Our environment when running the experiments:
 - Debian 9
 - python 2.7.13
 - dynet v2.0.2
 - a few external python modules: docopt progressbar editdistance 
 

### Setup
```git clone --recursive ```

In order to setup a few things and compile the Chinese Restaurant
